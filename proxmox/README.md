# Proxmox Server Setup

My Proxmox server is the central hub for everything in my homelab, with only a few exceptions. I chose a hypervisor environment because I prefer the isolation it provides, and being able to spin up or shut down VMs and LXCs without worrying about affecting other services is a huge benefit for me.

In this folder, you’ll find my main README.md along with the folders for hardware, installation, lxc-containers, vm-setup, storage, and diagrams. Each section breaks down how my Proxmox server is built, how it runs, and how it interacts with the rest of my environment
